## Advanced Call Recording Settings for CyanogenMod

Features:

* enable 3-dot->Settings->Calls->Call Recording Format Menu
* enable call recording for CyanogenMod
* use Voice Call audio source for recording
* record incoming calls or outgoing calls only
* include contact name in recording file name
* support CM 11.0, 12.0, 12.1, 13.0, 14.0

Recording format menu is needed for Samsung Note 3 (SM-N900T) because the AMR-WB format fails. AAC works great though!

recording files are saved in `/sdcard/CallRecordings` folder.
